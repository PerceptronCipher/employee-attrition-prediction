Employee Attrition Prediction - Data Documentation


# Project Overview
This data science project tackles the critical business challenge of employee attrition prediction. Through rigorous data preprocessing and feature engineering, I've transformed raw HR data into a machine learning-ready dataset that can accurately predict which employees are likely to leave the company.

# Dataset Description
Raw Data (raw/)
The original dataset contains employee information with various demographic, job-related, and satisfaction metrics. Key characteristics:

1,470 employee records
Mixed data types: categorical (departments, job roles, etc.) and numerical (age, income, etc.)
Target variable: Employee attrition (Yes/No)

# Processed Data (processed/processed_attrition_data.csv)
After comprehensive preprocessing, we've created a clean dataset optimized for machine learning:
Final Statistics:

1,470 rows (no data loss)
20 columns (19 features + 1 target)
60% feature reduction (from 47 to 19 features)
No missing values
No data leakage
No multicollinearity issues

# Data Engineering Pipeline
Phase 1: Data Quality Assessment
Working with the raw dataset, I immediately identified several data quality challenges that needed addressing:

# Mixed categorical and numerical data types requiring different encoding strategies
Potential data leakage through variables that directly revealed the target
High dimensionality with many potentially redundant features
Zero-variance features providing no predictive value

Phase 2: Strategic Feature Encoding
Rather than applying a one-size-fits-all approach, I implemented targeted encoding strategies:
Label Encoding Strategy (Preserving ordinal relationships):

CF_age_band: Maintained natural age progression (Under 25 < 25-34 < 35-44...)
Education: Preserved educational hierarchy (High School < Bachelor's < Master's...)
Business_Travel: Encoded by frequency (Non-Travel < Travel_Rarely < Travel_Frequently)

# One-Hot Encoding Strategy (Nominal categories without ordering):

Department: R&D, Sales, HR treated as independent categories
Job_Role: Each role encoded as separate binary features to capture role-specific patterns
Marital_Status: No inherent ordering between married, single, divorced

This strategic approach preserved meaningful relationships in the data while making it algorithm-ready.
Phase 3: Data Leakage Detection & Prevention
One of the most critical discoveries in this project was identifying subtle data leakage:
The Problem: Initial feature importance analysis revealed two features with suspiciously high predictive power (0.43+ mutual information scores):

CF_attrition_label (Ex-employee/Current employee)
CF_current_Employee (Employment status indicator)

The Solution: I realized these variables were essentially different representations of our target variable! An employee marked as "Ex-employee" would obviously have "Yes" for attrition. This was a classic case of data leakage that would have resulted in an overly optimistic but completely unrealistic model.
Removing these features was crucial for building a model that could actually generalize to real-world scenarios where we don't already know who's going to quit.
Phase 4: Scientific Feature Selection
I implemented mutual information regression to quantify the statistical relationship between each feature and employee attrition:

# Why Mutual Information?

Captures both linear AND non-linear relationships (unlike simple correlation)
Works seamlessly with mixed data types (categorical + numerical)
Provides objective, quantifiable feature importance scores

Results:

Applied threshold: MI > 0.01 to filter meaningful predictors
Outcome: Reduced feature space from 47 to 21 variables (55% reduction)
Impact: Eliminated noise while preserving all meaningful signals

# Top Predictive Features Discovered:

Age (0.061) - Most important predictor
Job Level (0.057) - Strong predictor
Job Involvement (0.046) - Employee engagement matters
Laboratory Technician role (0.040) - Specific role impact
Monthly Income (0.034) - Financial factor

Phase 5: Multicollinearity Resolution
Applied correlation analysis to identify and resolve feature redundancy:

Identified highly correlated pairs (correlation > 0.8)
Strategic removal: Eliminated Job Level (kept Monthly Income) due to 95% correlation
Preserved information: Kept more direct/actionable variables from each correlated pair
Final result: 19 independent, informative features

Ready for Production
For Data Scientists & ML Engineers
pythonimport pandas as pd

# Load the engineered dataset
data = pd.read_csv('processed/processed_attrition_data.csv')

# Features and target are ready for immediate use
X = data.drop('Attrition', axis=1)  # 19 engineered features
y = data['Attrition']               # Binary target (0=Stays, 1=Leaves)

# Perfect for train/test splitting and model training
Business Value Delivered
This preprocessing pipeline transforms raw HR data into actionable insights:

Predictive Power: Age and job level emerged as strongest attrition indicators
Actionable Insights: Employee satisfaction metrics show clear relationship to retention
Strategic Focus: Specific roles (Lab Technician) identified as high-risk positions
Resource Optimization: 60% reduction in feature complexity without information loss

# Model-Ready Guarantees

Zero missing values - No imputation needed
Balanced feature encoding - Optimal for all ML algorithms
Leakage-free - Model will generalize to unseen data
Multicollinearity resolved - No redundant information
Scientifically selected features - Each variable adds unique predictive value

# Technical Innovation Highlights
Advanced Feature Engineering: Instead of generic preprocessing, I analyzed each variable's underlying nature to apply the most appropriate encoding strategy.
Data Leakage Detection: Identified and eliminated subtle but critical data leakage that could have compromised model reliability.
Mutual Information Analysis: Leveraged information theory to objectively quantify feature importance, going beyond basic correlation analysis.
Multicollinearity Resolution: Applied correlation analysis to eliminate redundant features while preserving maximum information content.
This project demonstrates end-to-end data science thinking: from raw business data to production-ready machine learning dataset. The preprocessing pipeline successfully transformed messy, mixed-type data into a clean, modeling-ready format while preserving all meaningful predictive information.
