## Key Insights

**The Class Imbalance Challenge:**
The most significant finding wasn't in the data patterns but in the modeling approach. Initial high-accuracy models were useless because they optimized for the wrong objective. The breakthrough came from reframing the problem: we needed to catch departures, not maximize overall accuracy.

**Predictive Patterns:**
Age, job level, and satisfaction metrics emerged as the strongest predictors. Interestingly, factors like gender and education field showed minimal predictive power, suggesting attrition is driven more by job experience and engagement than demographics.

**The 73% Solution:**
The final model catches 73% of employees who leave while maintaining practical precision. It's not perfect, but it's actionable - which matters more in real-world deployment.

## Using These Reports

**For Stakeholders:**
Start with `model_performance.md` for the business case and actionable recommendations. The visualizations in `figures/` provide supporting evidence for the conclusions.

**For Technical Reviewers:**
The confusion matrices and ROC curves show the model's performance characteristics. Feature importance visualizations validate the preprocessing and selection decisions documented in the data folder.

**For Future Development:**
These reports establish baseline performance metrics. Any model improvements should be measured against the 73% recall benchmark.

## Report Generation

All visualizations were generated programmatically in the notebooks and saved at 300 DPI for presentation quality. The analysis focused on business-relevant insights rather than exhaustive statistical exploration.

## What's Missing

These reports don't include:
- Detailed hyperparameter tuning logs (kept in notebooks)
- Alternative modeling approaches that were explored but not pursued
- Raw statistical outputs (available in notebooks)

The goal was clarity and actionability, not comprehensive documentation of every experiment.
